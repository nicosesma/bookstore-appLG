Create a simple content management system for an online bookstore

## Description

Create a simple content management system that allows users to add, delete, or update books.  Books entered in the system can be viewed in a listing, or searched for using basic searches (title, author, genre).

## Context

Creating this web application will provide exposure to:
* Express (or other web framework)
* Javascript
* Simple relational database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with SQL practice
* Simple server side templating (to render data retrieved from the database)

## Specifications

- [ ] Any user can add books into the system via an admin page
- [ ] Books entered in the system are listed on the home page, in pages of 10
- [ ] Users can search for books by title OR by author OR by genre, and search results will be presented in a new page
- [ ] Users can view book details on a book detail page, linked to from the listing or search pages
- [ ] All code submissions are peer reviewed via GitHub PR by at least two members of the team, and master is always in a stable state (tests passed, site functions)

### Required

- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

## Quality Rubric

- Code is well formatted without any linting errors
- Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
- Functions are small and serve a single purpose
- Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure
- Code is reasonably tested with a test suite
- Interface is user friendly
